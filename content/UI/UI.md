## UI

Welcome to UI!
UI is an essential part of a game, especially one where dialogue is the main component.
But in my time working on Fangans I've noticed that UI is one of the most underutilized and often forgotten parts in projects. Mostly due to having priorities elsewhere or lack of man power. 

There's a lot of info to cover, but not to worry, most of this is self explanitory from images shown. 

## List of UI Regions
- [Title Screen(Main Menu)](Title_Screen.md)
- [Pop Up](PopUp)
- Save/Load
